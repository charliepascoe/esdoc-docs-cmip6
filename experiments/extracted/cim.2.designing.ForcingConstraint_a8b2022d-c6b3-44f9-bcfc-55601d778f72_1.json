These regional effects are a combination of stratospheric induced UV variations (\u201ctop-down\u201d) as well as surface effects induced by visible and IR variations and atmosphere-ocean coupling (\u201cbottom-up\u201d). However there are still uncertainties in the atmospheric solar signal and its transfer mechanism(s).\nIn order to best represent regional solar effects, it is important for climate models to use spectrally resolved solar irradiance data. This can be done only in models with a well resolved radiation scheme. There has been some discussion on the magnitude of spectral solar irradiance (SSI) changes in particular in the UV part of the spectrum, which is important not only for middle atmosphere heating but also ozone chemistry (Ermolli et al., 2013). Recent progress has been made to better constrain the SSI forcing and an improved version of earlier SSI recommendations will be provided this time.\nPrecipitating energetic particles from the sun (predominantly protons) and the magnetosphere (predominantly electrons) provide an additional pathway of solar forcing . They affect the ionization levels in the polar middle and upper atmosphere, leading to significant changes of the chemical composition. In particular, the production of NOx and HOx imposes changes of ozone via catalytic cycles, potentially affecting temperature and winds. Recent model studies and the analysis of meteorological data have provided evidence for a dynamical coupling of this signal to the lower atmosphere, leading to EPP induced surface climate variations on the regional scale (e.g., Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al, 2009; Rozanov et al., 2012). In addition, cosmic rays (CR, predominantly protons and alpha particles) - also modulated by the Sun - are the main source of ionization in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. While the connection between CR ionization and cloud production and therefore convection is still under debate, its chemical impact via ozone-depleting catalytic cycles and subsequent dynamical forcing are rather well understood (Callisto et al., 2011).\nDue to the increasing evidence for particle-induced surface climate impacts in addition to SSI-related variations, recommendations for consideration of proton-, electron- and CR-induced chemical modulations have been added to the CMIP6 solar forcing dataset. In particular the importance of solar induced ozone changes is becoming increasingly evident for a correct representation of solar climate signals. We therefore recommend for climate models without interactive chemistry to use the CMIP6 ozone database (provided by CCMI, M. Hegglin and J.-F. Lamarque) which is consistent with the here proposed solar forcing recommendations.", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "context": "Solar forcing for CMIP6", "citationStr": "Solar Forcing for CMIP6"}], "longName": "Historical Cosmic Ray Forcing", "keywords": ["Solar Forcing", "Historical", "Cosmic Ray", "Forcing", "Solar"], "forcingType": "observed"}
